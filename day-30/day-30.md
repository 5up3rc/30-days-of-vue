We've covered a lot of material in the past 30 days. Some of the high-level topics we discussed are:

-   The Vue Instance and Data Reactivity
-   Vue Directives
-   The Vue Instance lifecycle
-   Vue Components and Single-File Components
-   How to use the `vue-cli` to bootstrap our apps
-   State management best practices
-   Client-side routing
-   Unit Testing

## There is so much more!

Although we covered a lot of topics in our first 30 days, there is so much more! How do we know? We wrote a [book](https://www.fullstack.io/vue/)! But before we talk about thatâ€¦ here are some resources weâ€™ve found really useful in our journey working with Vue.

### The Vue Core Documentation

The Vue core documentation have a reputation for being one of the best-written technical documentations out thereâ€¦ and for very good reason! Translated in seven languages, the Vue docs explains all the nifty details in a simple and clean manner.

### The Vue Style Guide

Link: <https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/>

The Vue Style Guide is the official style guide for Vue specific code and provides a set of standards that help avoid errors and general anti-patterns.

### The Vue Cookbook

Link: <https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/>

The Vue Cookbook differentiates from the core documentation by highlighting â€˜recipesâ€™ that dive in to certain topics in a broader sense (for e.g. [how do we package Vue Components for npm?](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/packaging-sfc-for-npm.html)).

### Vue Mastery

A learning resource for Vue developers helmed by the ever talented [Gregg Pollack](https://twitter.com/greggpollack) and [Adam Jahr](https://twitter.com/AdamJahr). The Vue Mastery video courses are crisply composed with engaging graphics to help guide viewers to understand all the ins and outs of the Vue framework.

I> Gregg and Adam also co-produce the [official Vue.js News and Podcast](https://news.vuejs.org/)!

### Vue Land - The Vue Discord Channel

-   Integrating Vuex to a server-persisted app.
-   Advanced routing with dynamic route matching, navigation guards, and authenticated routes.
-   An in-depth review of unit testing which involve testing components in a Vue Router and Vuex integrated setting.
-   Forms forms forms! We cover form validations, from basic form inputs through validating and integrating with Vuex.
-   For the full package - access to a series of videos, almost 2hrs in length, to _set up_, _build_, and _deploy_ an **entire Vue.js application** from scratch - [check out the app here](http://simplecoincap.com/)!
-   And much much more.

All the above are all done within the context of building **much larger applications** as well. Check out the book page at [www.fullstack.io/vue](https://www.fullstack.io/vue) for more details.
